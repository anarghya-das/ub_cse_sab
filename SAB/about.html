										<h2>About SAB</h2>
										<p> </p>
									</header>

								  <h3> So what is SAB? </h3>
									<p> The Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate Student Advisory Board (SAB) was created in the fall of 2015.
										The SAB advises the co-directors of UG studies (henceforth co-DUSes) on any and all issues related to undergrads.
										Since then the SAB has the driving force behind many events, in particular the CS Ed Week celebrations. The SAB also
										functions as a sounding board for the co-DUSes to get some quick feedback on UG related issues
										(and was closely involved in the recent curricula revisions). </p>

									 <p> SAB has many new and exciting initiatives we are working on for our students, and we are always looking
										for a range of diverse individuals to contribute their perspectives and skills to the team. </p>

									<h3> But what does SAB do? </h3>
									<p>SAB members are expected to contribute to (and preferably take the lead on) various departmental events including,
										but not limited to (1) CS Ed week celebrations, (2) CSE Open houses, (3) the CSE stop on SEAS Orientation tours.
										The SAB is expected to be primarily student run and is expected to give feedback to the co-DUSes on issues
										relating to the undergraduate experience in the department, especially ideas on how it can be enhanced. </p>

									<h3>How can I join SAB? </h3>
										<p>SAB recruits new members typically in the beginning of the fall semester. We look for a diverse range of
										candidates and backgrounds. If you are thinking of applying, please check out the membership page or reach out
								  	to one of the co-DUSes! </p>
